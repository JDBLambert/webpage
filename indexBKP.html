	<p>Hello, you have found yourself on my site.  I am planning on doing a complete overhaul of this site (in the far future), so most of this is not permanent. I am still trying to get the hang of how all this works. I am working on the new site in private and don't currently wish to share it with the world. I will, however, continue to work on this site until my plans have become finalized.</p><br><br>
	<h1>About the Developer</h1>
	<p>Hello, my name is Jacob. I am the developer of this site. I am learning to write with HTML and css. I ocasionally get help from one of my friends. This is the same friend that also hosts this site. Yes, he has his own server. He also has a site. The links are at the bottom of the page. I am open to suggestions to the site, however, there are no ways for you to make comments on this page. That might be a feature that I add. A login and comment service, yah, that sounds good.</p><br>
